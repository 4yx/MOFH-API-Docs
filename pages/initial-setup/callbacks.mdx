# Callbacks
The MyOwnFreeHost API allows you to set up a callback URL that will be called when a user accounts gets activated, suspended or unsuspended, or when an SQL cluster gets added to a user.

## Setup

### 1. Log in to the MyOwnFreeHost reseller panel
This can be accessed at [https://panel.myownfreehost.net/index.php](https://panel.myownfreehost.net/index.php) and the page should look something like this:
![Login page](/login.png)

And you should be logged in. The dashboard looks something like this:
![Dashboard](/dashboard.png)


### 2. Go to the API setup page
This can be done by clicking on the "API" link in the sidebar, and then clicking on "Setup WHM API". Once you have done that, this is what the page should look like:
![WHM API page](/whm_api.png)

Then, select the domain name you want to create the accounts on and click on "Get Keys/ Set allow ip address".

### 3. Add the callback URL
Once you are there, add your callback URL to the "API Callback URL" field. It should look something like this:
![Callback URL added](/callback.png)
In this example the URL `https://example.com/callback` is used.

Then, click on "Update Settings" and everything should be set up!
