# Introduction

Welcome to the MyOwnFreeHost (MOFH) API Documentation. This documentation is unofficial and provided by [Robert S](https://robert-s.dev) and [contributors](https://github.com/Wallvon/MOFH-API-Docs/graphs/contributors).

If you find any errors throughout this API reference, please make an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wallvon/MOFH-API-Docs/issues/new).

There are examples in cURL and Python, but if you know any other programming language and are willing to contribute please consider making a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wallvon/MOFH-API-Docs).

**Side-notes**
- You can create up to 3 accounts per person with the MOFH API. You _may_ be able to create more accounts, but this is not advised and when I asked the iFastNet team they said that there was a limit of 3 accounts per person.
- The MOFH API is pretty limited, so you can't really do more than what is listed here without doing some trickery and whatnot.
- The SSL certificate on `https://panel.myownfreehost.net/xml-api/` tends to expire, so you may need to turn off SSL verification.
- You can use both `https://panel.myownfreehost.net/xml-api/` and `https://panel.myownfreehost.net:2087/xml-api/` to access the API, but on the latter the SSL certificate is practically guaranteed to be expired.

With that out of the way, let's get started, shall we?
