**Side-notes**
- You can create up to 3 accounts per email with the MOFH API. You _may_ be able to create more accounts, but this is not advised and when I asked the iFastNet team they said that there was a limit of 3 accounts per person.
- The MOFH API is pretty limited, so you can't really do more than what is listed here without doing some trickery and whatnot.
- The SSL certificate on `https://panel.myownfreehost.net:2087/xml-api/` tends to expire, so you may need to turn off SSL verification.

With that out of the way, let's get started, shall we?
